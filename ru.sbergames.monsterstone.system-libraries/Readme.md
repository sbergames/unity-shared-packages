# C# System Libraries for Unity

This package contains commonly-used C# class library assemblies that are not included in Unity by default.

Next libraries are included:
* [System.Memory v4.5.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/4.5.4)  
  Provides `System.[ReadOnly]Span` and `System.[ReadOnly]Memory`.
* [System.Buffers v4.5.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Buffers/4.5.1)  
  Provides `System.Buffers.ArrayPool<T>`
* [System.Collections.Immutable v5.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable/5.0.0)  
  Provides a set of immutable collections under `System.Collections.Immutable` namespace.
* [System.Text.Json v5.0.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json/5.0.2)  
  Provides high-performance, low-allocating, and standards-compliant capabilities to process JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which includes serializing objects to JSON text and deserializing JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. It also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM) for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.

Next libraries are included as a dependency:
* [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe v6.0.0-rc.1.21451.13](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/6.0.0-rc.1.21451.13)
* [Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces v5.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces/5.0.0)
* [System.Text.Encodings.Web v5.0.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Encodings.Web/5.0.1)
* [System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions v4.5.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions/4.5.4)
